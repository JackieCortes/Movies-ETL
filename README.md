# Movies-ETL
Módulo 8

**Summary:**

Amazing Prime loved the development and wanted to keep updated. The customer required our support to take new data, tranform and load it. The code was refactored the codeto create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

The Deliverable 1 and 2 worked out without error, however Deliverable 3 and 4 marked an error regarding the merged databases in the field where they need to link the information. Because of that reason it was not possible to bring it to the Postgress SQL Database.
